### Explore places near you and many other cities around the world.

Feeling in the mood to try a new place or planning to visit a city you don't know much about, Wanas app helps you explore places around you, and many other cities around the world.

You can filter places by "food, drinks, coffee, shops, arts, and outdoors", you can also control the search radius "5km, 10km, and 20km" or let the app suggest the radius according to the density of the places in the searched spot, and sort them by popularity or by the distance from you.

Visit the details page of any place and you can find its address, how others rated it, pricing hint, and tips that can be helpful; if you prefer using Google Maps, there will be a link to show the place location on Google Maps app.
